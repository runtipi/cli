> ‚ö†Ô∏è Tipi is built and maintained by volunteers. There is no guarantee of support or security when you use Tipi. While the system is considered stable, it is still in active development and may contain bugs.

Runtipi CLI is an updated version of the old typescript based CLI that many of you used. The old CLI was slow, big in size and insecure. So we are happy to present you the all new Rust CLI. It is just a few killobytes, extremely fast and very secure. With the new CLI we don't need to depend on a node js runtime so the speed is faster than ever! To get started follow the instructions bellow.

## Getting Started

If you already have a runtipi instance you can just stop it delete the old cli and download our new one from the release page [here](https://github.com/runtipi/cli/releases).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The CLI version and tipi version should match in order for the installation to work. If you try to use a different cli and tipi version you may encouter issues.

## üî® Building locally

If you like to you can build the CLI locally in your own machine. To do that you must have cargo and rust installed on your system. Then you can just clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/runtipi/cli
```

Then you can just build the CLI with:

```bash
cargo build
```

The CLI will be in the `target/debug/` folder named `runtipi-cli`
